## tools 

### tech
- computer with a good browser (please consider using chrome or firefox) 
- sign up for accounts on [github](https://github.com/), [general assembly](https://accounts.generalassemb.ly/users/sign_up), [glitch](https://glitch.com/), and [codepen](https://codepen.io/). you can use github to log in to glitch and codepen! 

### design
- notebook: i recommend using grid paper for drawing layouts! 
- pens: i use multiple colors for drawing sections 
- color palette tools: [coolors](https://coolors.co/) and [adobe color](https://color.adobe.com/create) - sign up for an account on whichever you prefer if you want to save color palettes 
- [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): look at it if you aren't already familiar - if you struggle with indecision then use [inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) which is a variable font, which is very new and exciting to me!! 
we're not gonna worry about design programs just yet!
